# SwifTacToe

A very basic command line game of Tic Tac Toe written in Swift and Visual Studio Code.

Ensure that you have Swift 4.x.x installed locally then clone this repository and run:

```
$ swift run
```

Enjoy!

### Looks for help docs?

Run `swift build` and not the location of the executable:

```
$ swift build

```

Run the execuable with the `--help` or `-H` flag:

```
~/workspace/swift/SwifTacToe (+2h|master) â€¢ $ ./.build/x86_64-apple-macosx10.10/debug/SwifTacToe --help
